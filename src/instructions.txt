For using the application can happen in two separate ways.

1.) The fist way of using is the manuell execution of the train and test methods in src/snakeAI/agents/ppo/ppo_train
    respectively src/snakeAI/agents/dqn/dqn_train or src/snakeAI/agents/ppo/ppo_test respectively
    src/snakeAI/agents/dqn/dqn_train. There you can set the parameters directly.
    In the following way those parameters will be explained.

2.) Ths second way of using the application are the interface methods main_make_statistics, main_train, main_test.
    main_make_statistics:
        FIG_PATH: Path of the statistic which will be created.
        USE_CASE: Train or test run.
        RUN_TYPE: Baseline or optimized.
        STATISTIC_RUN_NUMBER: Number of the of be evaluated statistic runs.
        AGENT_LIST: List of agents which should be processed.

        An example cmd command for starting the application on Windows os represents the following:

        Path\_to\_File\Bachelor-Snake-AI\src\: python main_make_statistics.py
        "Path\of\statistic" "train" "baseline" 2 []

    main_train:
        Agent Type PPO
            N_ITERATIONS: Iteration which should be processed for learning.
            LR_ACTOR: Learning rate of the actor.
            LR_CRITIC: Learning rate of the critic.
            GAMMA: Discounting factor. Important for the time preference.
            K_EPOCHS: Number of the epochs for learning with one data batch.
            EPS_CLIP: Clip Value of the PPO
            BOARD_SIZE: Size of the playground. E.g. (8, 8)
            STATISTIC_RUN_NUMBER: Number of the Run. Important for saving the generated data.
            AGENT_NUMBER: Number of the to be examined agent. Important for saving.
            RUN_TYPE: Type of the statistic run. BaseLine or Optimized.
            OPTIMIZATION: "A", "B", "AB", "None"
            GPU: Should the GPU be used.

            An example cmd command for starting the application on Windows os represents the following:

            "PPO" 30000 0.00015 0.0003 0.95 10 0.2 "(8, 8)" 1 3 "optimized" "None" True

        Agent Type DQN

            LR: Learning rate of the DQN.
            GAMMA: Discounting factor. Important for the time preference.
            BATCH_SIZE: Size of the batches.
            MAX_MEM_SIZE: Maximal memory size.
            EPS_DEC: Subtrahend which reduces epsilon.
            EPS_END": Lower limit of epsilon.
            STATISTIC_RUN_NUMBER: Number of the Run. Important for saving the generated data.
            AGENT_NUMBER: Number of the to be examined agent. Important for saving.
            RUN_TYPE: Type of the statistic run. BaseLine or Optimized.
            OPTIMIZATION: "A", "B", "AB", "None"
            GPU: Should the GPU be used.

            An example cmd command for starting the application on Windows os represents the following:

    main_test:
        Agent Type PPO
            MODEL_PATH: Path of the model file
            N_ITERATIONS: Iteration which should be processed for learning.
            BOARD_SIZE: Size of the batches.
